# Optimized-Spectral-Analysis-of-ISM-Band-Signals-via-SDR
AbstractThe proliferation of wireless communication protocols, specifically IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth, necessitates robust spectrum monitoring and analysis tools. Software Defined Radios (SDRs) provide a flexible hardware platform for capturing these signals; however, direct-conversion receivers often introduce hardware impairments, most notably DC offset, while subsequent spectral analysis is prone to spectral leakage. This paper presents a comprehensive signal processing pipeline for the analysis of captured RF signals using USRP and ADALM Pluto hardware.We propose two primary enhancement techniques to improve spectrogram fidelity. First, to address the inherent DC offset prevalent in zero-IF SDR architectures, we implement a first-order Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) DC blocker. This pre-processing stage effectively mitigates carrier feedthrough without distorting the near-DC frequency components of the target signal. Second, we analyze the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) parameterization, specifically focusing on the trade-off between main-lobe width and side-lobe attenuation. We identify and propose an optimal Beta ($\beta$) value for the Kaiser window that maximizes dynamic range for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed processing chain significantly enhances spectral clarity, reduces noise floor artifacts, and improves the detection of transient packet headers in congested 2.4 GHz environments.Keywords — Software Defined Radio (SDR), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), DC Offset Removal, Kaiser Window, Spectrogram, IIR Filter, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.
